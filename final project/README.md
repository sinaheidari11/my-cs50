Hello, world.
This my final project explanations 
This app will create random passwords in three different security levels from weak security to medium and strong security.
to use this app simply open up a folder named dist and click on passwordgenerator.exe then a window will pop up for you in which you can choose the length of your password,
from 8 characters to 20 characters.
You can use this app to make a password for every account you want.
To make this project I used Python and a very famous GUI from Python called TKinter and to learn how to work with Tkinter I needed almost 2 weeks,
and after that, I managed to make the program.
My idea was simple but a bit difficult to make.
In my plan ill be using this app and another app combined to make an app that will,
lock any file on your pc and the file will remain locked if you transfer it to another pc.
